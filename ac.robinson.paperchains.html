  <h1>PaperChains / AudioCanvas Privacy policy</h1>
  <p><em>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their Personally Identifiable Information is being used. Personally Identifiable Information is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information.</em></p>

  <h2>What personal information do we collect?</h2>
  <p>PaperChains only collects or shares personal information if you explicitly choose to do so by recording audio.</p>
  <p>The camera on your device is used only to recognise QR codes.</p>
  <p>When you choose to record audio and attach this to a document, PaperChains uses <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> to store this audio. From this point, SoundCloud's privacy policy will apply.</p>

  <h2>When do we collect information?</h2>
  <p>PaperChains only collects or shares personal information when you explicitly choose to do so by recording audio.</p>

  <h2>How do we use your information?</h2>
  <p>Audio that you choose to share is stored by SoundCloud in order to allow other users of the same document to listen to your annotations.</p>

  <h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
  <p>No information is collected by PaperChains itself. Audio that you choose to share using SoundCloud is protected by that service's separate privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>Third-party disclosure</h2>
  <p>PaperChains does not sell, trade or otherwise transfer your information.

  <h2>Third-party products or services</h2>
  <p>PaperChains does not include or offer third-party products or services.
