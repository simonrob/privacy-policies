  <h1>Chameleon Privacy policy</h1>
  <p><em>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their Personally Identifiable Information is being used. Personally Identifiable Information is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information.</em></p>

  <h2>What personal information do we collect</h2>
  <p>Like millions of other apps, Chameleon uses Google Analytics and Crashlytics to help us better understand the ways people use it, and get information about any errors that occur.</p>

  <p>Google Analytics collects data about the way you use the app (which features you use, and how long you use them for), the type of phone you're using, and several other types of related information.</p>
  <p>Crashlytics collects similar information, but when a crash occurs, it also includes detail about the specific errors that caused the problem.</p>

  <h2>When do we collect information?</h2>
  <p>Chameleon collects Google Analytics and Crashlytics data whenever you use the app.</p>

  <h2>How do we use your information?</h2>
  <p>The information from Google Analytics and Crashlytics allows us to track and fix problems with Chameleon, and also better understand how people use its features. This helps us choose which aspects are most important to focus on developing.</p>

  <h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
  <p>Your information is protected by the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="http://crashlytics.com/terms/">Crashlytics</a> Terms of Service and Privacy Policies.</p>

  <h2>Third-party disclosure</h2>
  <p>Chameleon does not sell, trade or otherwise transfer your information.
